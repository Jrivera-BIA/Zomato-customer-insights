# Data Overview

Raw user and order data used in this analysis is not included in this repository
for privacy and licensing reasons.

The project uses two main tables:

- **users**: user_id, age, gender, marital_status, occupation, monthly_income, educational_qualifications, family_size  
- **orders**: order_id, user_id, order_date, sales_amount, sales_qty, restaurant_id

Any dataset with a similar schema can be used to recreate the analysis.
